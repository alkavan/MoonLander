# MoonLander

A game where your goal is to land safely at mission location,
or transfer cargo with your ship.

### Install

```npm install```

### Run the development server:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser


### Build for production:

```npm run deploy```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
